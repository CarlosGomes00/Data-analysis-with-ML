# Data-analysis-with-ML


This project was conceived in an academic context, in the curricular unit "Intelligent Systems for Bioinformatics" of the master's degree in Bioinformatics and was developed by:

- [Carlos Gomes](https://github.com/CarlosGomes00)
- [Diogo Esteves](https://github.com/dasesteves)
- [Joana Lopes](https://github.com/joanalopes7)
- [Tiago Miranda](https://github.com/tiagomiranda24)


This project involves the analysis of a dataset using machine learning algorithms with Python as the programming language. The work will be documented in a Jupyter Notebook, organized into sections, which will include the steps of the analysis performed. Each section will succinctly explain the procedures undertaken and the decisions made throughout the analysis.

The dataset chosen for this project is derived from the [DisGeNET](https://tdcommons.ai/multi_pred_tasks/gdi#disgenet) platform, specifically focusing on gene-disease associations. DisGeNET is a comprehensive knowledge platform that integrates data from various sources to provide extensive information on the relationships between genes and diseases.

To ensure that all the project's dependencies are installed correctly, we recommend using a Conda environment. You can easily create the environment with the project's dependencies from the env.yml file included in this repository.

Steps to set up the environment:

**1. Make sure you have Conda installed.**
If you don't have Conda installed, download and install Miniconda or Anaconda.

**2. Clone the repository to your local machine:**
If you haven't cloned the repository yet, use the following command to clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/joanalopes7/Data-analysis-with-ML
```

**3. Create the Conda environment from the env.yml file:**
Navigate to the cloned project directory and run the following command to create the Conda environment with the required dependencies:

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

**4. Activate the Conda environment:**
Once the environment is created, activate it with the following command:

```
conda activate noteSI
```
Note: The environment name is specified in the env.yml file. If you havenâ€™t changed the file, the default name will be the one listed there.

**5. Verify that the dependencies were installed correctly:** You can check if the environment was created successfully and if all dependencies were installed by running:

```
conda list
```

**6. You're all set!**
